This is my home page which I adapted from the academic page template forked from [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

The template is powerful enough the support personal page in a aesthetic way, and it helps me to better keep track of my academic and life.
