Based on the paper [Information Aggregation in Exponential Family Markets](http://slahaie.net/pubs/AbernethyKuLa14.pdf), we simulated the trading process of the prediction market.

We verified that information aggregated from traders is consistent with the underlying truth and constructed Bayesian agent model for the prediction market. 

Here is the link to our [summary report](https://github.com/shineyruan/Reading-Group-Kutty-Meetings/blob/master/summary-paper.pdf), and our source code for simulation: [source code](https://github.com/dnaihao/Simulation-Prediction-Market)
