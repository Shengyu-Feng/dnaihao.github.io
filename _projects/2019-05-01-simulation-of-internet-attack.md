This is a project I did when I interned at Deepfield, Nokia. In the project, I configured NTP server on AWS to respond to NTP Monlist request, generated ICMP and NTP attack traffic on AWS, configured NGINX server on AWS for port forwarding, and integrated this new feature into Vlabs (internal tool that we use to deploy on AWS cloud).
