We implemented the Legend of Zelda (Dungeon) with a customized level in this project. The Legend of Zelda was a 1986 NES game developed and published by Nintendo. This game, among several others, was directly responsible for reviving the North American video game industry after the Video Game Crash of 1983. The titles would beget lucrative, enduring franchises for Nintendo, which is still releasing popular Zelda titles to this day. **The link to the web deliverable of our game is at the bottom of this post. Press 4 to enter our customized level. Press 1 to enter/exit godmode.** Our Zelda can use sword, bow, bomb and boomerang. Keese, Gel, Goriya, Bladetrap, Wallmasters and other enemies would appear in different rooms. We also have the old man room, 2D bow room available for players to explore. Collectables such as Ruppees, hearts will be dropped by enemies when they die. 


Here is what you will become in the customized level:
