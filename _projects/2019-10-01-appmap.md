This is a project under Censored Planet at the University of Michigan. We investigated the censorship of apps across countries.

In the project, we are implementing scrapers that can scrape apps from multiple popular app markets and investigate the difference of apps that we crawl.

We are currently working on this project, and the project is supervised by [professor Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi/)
