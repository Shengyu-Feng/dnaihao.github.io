Pedestrian safety is a big concern for autonomous vehicles. Most autonomous vehicle systems are biased towards normal pedestrians. The vulnerable road users (VPR), however, are usually considered as edge cases in most studies. Few studies care about the safety and travel experience of vulnerable road users(VRU) such as wheelchair patients and cyclists. In this project, we are aimed at creating a computer vision application that distinguishes different types of VRU’s to better facilitate under-represented road users.

The project goal is to design algorithms that can give real time alerts to automated driving systems of incoming wheelchair users.

This project is aimed at supporting  vulnerable road users  in terms of their safety and travel experience .  Bus drivers as well as autonomous vehicles will benefit from the project  because they are more likely to be alerted when there are VRU’s on the road. Also, by detecting VRUs at front door, autonomous vehicles are able to facilitate them.

We are currently working on this project.
