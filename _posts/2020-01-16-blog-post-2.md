My order of watching Star War series is a bit unusual, I watched *The Rise of Skywalker* when I visited my aunt several weeks ago, then I watched *The Last Jedi* in the last week.

*The Rise of Skywalker*
======

I don't like *The Rise of Skywalker*, though I admit several attractive points caught me in this movie. One scene I like the most is the ruins of Death Star. There is a twisted beauty embedded in the broken pieces of the once so powerful weapon in the galaxy. When Rey and Kylo Ren fight each other, with the sunlight coming through the remains of the Death Star, the strong contrast between light and dark sides, hope and despair are presented to the audience strongly. 

Even with those careful-designed and delicate scenes, I doubted the meaning of the last scene, when Rey says she is a "Skywalker". I agree that she receives lots of help from Luke Skywalker, she has a mixed feeling towards Kylo Ren, the son of Leia Skywalker and kisses him in the end. But is this enough for a person to change his/her last name? 

If she changes her last name because of the help from Luke, well, if in the future, another person helps her even more, will she change her last name again? If she changes her last name because of her relationship with Kylo Ren whose last name is not Skywalker, I don't think she has any reason to change her last name. 

Does she change her name because she is ashamed of her grandfather? I am deeply sorry if this is the case. A person, if strong enough, will not care about what his/her last name is. No one has the right to judge you by your last name. Moreover, you should not judge yourself by your last name in your heart. Even in the history of Skywalker, there are certain people such as Das Vida who falls to the dark side of the force. I don't think Rey is a good example for us, especially for those who grow up in a different culture. Shall we get away with our original culture or our root just like Rey? No, we shall never do that. Our root is not a mistake, it is the very thing that makes us special. There is no shame to admit our root.

*The Last Jedi*
======
Compared to *The Rise of Skywalker*, *The Last Jedi* seems less exciting, as the Resistance loses almost all the fights. Even in the very end, what they achieve is to escape, or withdraw successfully, which certainly is not a win. But several scenes surprised me. For instance, none of my friends, nor I realized Luke uses force to project himself to the battlefield before it reveals itself at the end.

The scene that touched me most is how Amilyn Holdo sacrificed herself to save the Resistance during their desperate flight to Crait. The common plot for movies nowadays probably is that Poe Dameron saves the Resistance and defeats the First Order by bypassing Amilyn Holdo and taking his risky measures, which happens to succeed. But *The Last Jedi* stands out by telling a story of sacrifice, a story that is not made up of coincidence, but hard choices consistent with real life. When the First Order discovered the Resistance's plan and began blasting the helpless transports, Holdo chose to alter the Raddus's course so the cruiser was aimed at the pursuing Supremacy, sacrificed herself to save the Resistance.
